D GROUP: MVP Definition

1. Goal is to create a simulation of a vehicle drivetrain that consits of an input handler, 
engine module, gearbox and output visualisation.
  
    a) Input handler:
        -Takes user keyboard input and interprets it according to drivetrain expectations,
        -Sends interpreted user input on VCAN.
    b) Drivetrain:
        -Receives VCAN messages from input handler and acts accordingly on them,
        -Engine module emulating behaviour of a combustion engine,
        -Gearbox module emulating bahaviour of an automatic gearbox,
        -Commucicates on VCAN its status.
    c) Output handler:
        -Receives VCAN data sent by drivetrain and displays them to a user.
